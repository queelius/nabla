Description: Exact automatic differentiation for R functions. Provides a
    'composable' derivative operator D that computes gradients, 'Hessians',
    'Jacobians', and arbitrary-order derivative tensors at machine precision.
    D(D(f)) gives 'Hessians', D(D(D(f))) gives third-order tensors for
    skewness of MLEs, and so on to any order. Works through any R code
    including loops, branches, and control flow.
