\title{Compute value, first and second derivatives of a function}
\usage{
differentiate2(f, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A function of one argument (numeric or dual).}

\item{x}{A numeric value at which to differentiate.}
}
\value{
A named list with components \code{value}, \code{first}, and
\code{second}.
}
\description{
Evaluates \code{f} at a second-order dual variable seeded at \code{x},
returning all three quantities.
}
\examples{
differentiate2(sin, pi/4)
# $value = sin(pi/4)
# $first = cos(pi/4)
# $second = -sin(pi/4)
}
