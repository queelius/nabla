  "title": "nabla: Exact Derivatives via Automatic Differentiation",
  "description": "Exact automatic differentiation for R functions. Provides a composable derivative operator D that computes gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and arbitrary-order derivative tensors at machine precision. D(D(f)) gives Hessians, D(D(D(f))) gives third-order tensors for skewness of MLEs, and so on to any order. Works through any R code including loops, branches, and control flow.",
